# ML4HC_project1

To run the notebooks (`MLfHC_project1_pt1.ipynb` and `MLfHC_project1_pt2.ipynb`), you must first create a Python environment (version 3.10.13) and run

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(or other equivalent calls)

The notebooks should then guide you sequentially through the code for each part of the project. Make sure to have the data available at the locations specified by the paths in the notebooks.

Please note that the data split we used for Part 2 is slightly different from the original Kaggle data set (increased size of validation data split) - so in order to reproduce the results use the data set we uploaded to the GitHub repository of this project.
