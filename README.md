# ML4HC_project1

## Part 1

To run the notebook for this part (`MLfHC_project1_pt1.ipynb`), you must first create a Python environment (version 3.10.13) and run

```
pip install -r requirements_pt1.txt
```

(or other equivalent calls)

The notebook should then guide you sequentially through the code for this part of the project.
